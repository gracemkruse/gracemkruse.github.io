		                            Imposter is a spy themed card game designed to help students who feel lonely on campus, find activities that will introduce them to people, and places they might not know about otherwise. Students at Pepperdine often look like they have their lives together externally, which makes those who don’t feel like they have every minute of every day planned out, feel like they couldn’t be spend time with those kind of people on campus. However, everyone at Pepperdine is exactly the same. Trying to get through classes, work, meals, and activities, one day at a time. Imposter stems from looking at people and seeing someone they are not.

Inside the pack there are variety of cards with certain types of challenges varying in difficulty as people become more involved with the game. They accrue points by completing the tasks on the card and upload the evidence of their  uploaded to a leaderboard and top five players get to participate in an experience that caters to their interests. We wanted to shy away from monetary prizes because the end goal of the game was not to get things but to fully be able to enjoy and experience four years at Pepperdine.</p>
