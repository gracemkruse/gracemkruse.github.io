		                        <p class="lead">Imposter is a spy themed card game designed to help students who feel lonely on campus find activities that will introduce them to people and places they might not know about otherwise. Although people at Pepperdine look like they have every minute of their day together, everyone is in the same boat trying to figure out this new experience called college. Imposter stems from looking at people and seeing someone they are not.</p>

								<h3> How to Play</h3>

								<p class="lead">
		                            In order to be inducted into The Agency, people call a phone number hidden on campus and receive their mission packet. Inside the pack there are a variety of cards with challenges, varying in difficulty as people become more involved with the game. Players accrue points by completing the tasks on the card and upload the evidence of their accomplishments to a leaderboard. The top five players get to participate in an experience that caters to their interests. We wanted to shy away from monetary prizes because the end goal of the game was not to get things, but to enjoy and experience everything that Pepperdine, Malibu, and LA have to offer.

We knew from the start that we needed to find a way to get people to register other than adding our posters to the sea of promotional materials lining the walls of the Pepperdine Plaza. We also wanted to find a way for it to fit the theme, which helped us come up with our marketing materials. We came up with ideas like painting the rock with reflective paint and having people take a picture with the flash to find the secret phone number, business cards with a puzzle to solve, fortune cookies with custom riddles inside, a few posters in specific buildings, and quite a few more that we did not end up using. Within the first day we got five calls and by the end of the first week we had almost 50 registered.</p>

Landon Phillips, my supervisor and mentor, Chanse Alexander, who created sketches to be vectorized and assisted with colors and concepts for the cards. Esther Wong was our computer science expert. Genesis Trejo, the pre-med student and temporary lawyer, Isabel Hao, and Russell Wijaya who lost many nights of sleep while finishing up details on projects with fast approaching deadlines. Thank you to Christine Deng, the other lead on the project, Anna Speth co-director of the Genesis Lab, and the rest of the team: Alex Ksajikian, Treet Allison, and Jane Yi, who did everything else in the Genesis Lab while we obsessed over this game!</p>

  <h3>Bloopers</h3>
  <img alt="Imposter" class="8 mb-xs-16" src="img/imp/404.jpg">
  <p class="lead">During Imposter we ran into a few bumps in the road. The first problem we ran into was when we got a nice visit from Public Safety. They told us that in order to have these materials distributed throughout campus, we needed to have official documentation saying that it was affiliated with an on campus organization or program. They were justified in their concern, if someone made their way on campus and was asking students in a voicemail to leave their name, phone number, email, mailbox number, and mother’s maiden name (not actually), then that would be a potential threat to the community. However, our fear was that if we used logos from the makerspace, library, or the university then we would be seen as just another event that might alienate the people we were trying to engage. By the time they shutdown this first part of our operation, we had plenty of people to start the pilot.</p>

<p class="lead">The second problem we ran into was Google thinking we were sending out spam from our number. One day we were sending out messages to our registered “agents”. After we got through about thirty texts, the number was cut off. We couldn’t log in, check messages we were receiving, or finish sending out the invite to a weekend event. A few days later, Genesis Trejo, a pre-med student turned temporary lawyer, found a loophole in the Google Voice terms and services and got our number back in action. In case we didn’t get our number back, we prepared to get a new number or send out mass messages through email.
