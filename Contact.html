		                  <p class="lead"> The first time the typeface Mrs. Eaves was described to me, it was compared to a woman’s closet. Elegant, diverse, and full of accessories. That is undoubtedly true, with its flowing swashes, and extensive ligature library. Despite beautiful qualities, it is not necessarily a functional closet. It more closely resemble a closet full of heels. Although heals have a time and place to be worn, everyday errands are not the right occasion to wear them. Mrs. Eaves is the same way. It is perfect for display giving the covers of Penguin Classics the Wordpress logo, and short quotes, an elegant persona. It is not for text in books or blogs. When designing Mrs. Eaves, Zuzana Licko created it to be light and airy, and that goal was most definitely achieved. However in doing that, you either have a gray that is too light, or too much information on one page. All in all, I think Mrs. Eaves is a beautiful typeface, it just has to be used. </p>
