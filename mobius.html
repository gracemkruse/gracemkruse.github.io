		                            Mobius, is a theme park designed to let the user experience extreme anxiety to find complete peace. Each room in the escape room is designed to bring about the anxiety and paranoia of everyday life perfectionist. The puzzles in the escape room deal with four different aspects of anxiety: ambiguity, opinions, options, and standards. Once you finish the escape room, another experience will begin, that allows the user to be entirely out of control bringing about complete peace, showing that sometimes, the perfect solution, is to stop and let go.

There are no directions explaining the puzzle. The visitor must complete the puzzle to continue. Throughout the Ambiguity room, there will be no hint of whether the answer is right or wrong, starting off the experience with the stress of not knowing looming over their head.

		                            The second puzzle is about trying to keep everybody happy, and the realization that its just not possible. When going through the Opinions, the guest will go through the experience of trying to order a meal for a family of eleven. Every person has some specific need and they must balance all of them. While they are in the room, they will receive periodic phone calls from actual people to make them feel like their decision is more than just a puzzle room. Once they have come to conclusion, they must place the order and rank who is most and least satisfied in the family.

In Standards, the guest must create a design out of triangles, and submit it once it meets their own expectations. They are told that they can only continue once a committee has reviewed their work and accept it as satisfactory.

The same is true of life. Although it is helpful to think and prepare, there is a certain kind of Relief knowing that it is not always the best way to do something.

After going through five rooms working and controlling situations, the final room forces you to completely give up control. The final room is a roller coaster powered by air. It is designed to simulate the ocean with sounds and scents, and effects. Augmented reality jellyfish will be seen in the room, and the beauty and fluidity in their movement will be a calming visual for the guest. Although there will be things in the room creating a restful environment, they will not be able to enjoy it unless they let go, and enjoy the experience.
