		                            The first time the typeface Mrs. Eaves was described to me, it was compared to a woman’s closet. Elegant, diverse, and full of accessories. That is undoubtedly true, with its flowing swashes, and extensive ligature library. Despite beautiful qualities, it is not necessarily a functional closet. It more closely resemble a closet full of heals. Although heals have a time and place to be worn, everyday errands are not the right occasion to wear them. Mrs. Eaves is the same way. It is perfect for display giving the covers of Penguin Classics the Wordpress logo, and short quotes, an elegant persona. It is not for text in books or blogs. When designing Mrs. Eaves, Zuzana Licko created it to be light and airy, and that goal was most definitely achieved. However in doing that, you either have a gray that is too light, or too much information on one page. All in all, I think Mrs. Eaves is a beautiful typeface, it just has to be used at the right time, in the right place.

		                        <p class="lead">Since Mrs. Eaves is a display typeface, Cate Middleton seemed to be a good comparison. As the future Queen of England, it is her duty to always put her best foot forward despite any circumstance. Although the future of the country is not riding on her decisions, but the entirety of the United Kingdom is looking at how she makes her decisions. To continue on the idea of display, the characters of Mrs. Eaves, are being showcased in beauty contest.</p>

		                        <p class="lead">Above, our judge, Cate Middleton, explains the judging criteria and gives a background on why the contest is being hosted. She is looking for good examples of a transitional typeface as well as teardrop terminals and low x-height. She also shows how Baskerville, the predecessor of Mrs. Eaves, uses the same qualities.&nbsp;</p>
